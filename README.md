There are two ways to read the data from an Ampere.Storage.Pro. Both options are explained here.
- Variant 1: Via Modbus
- Variant 2: Via Rest (the Ampere.IQ Box is required here)

# Requirements:
- HomeAssistant with Visual Studio Server or File Editor Addon
- Ip addresses of inverter and IQ box (optional)

# Variant 1:
The inverter can be read out via Modbus TCP (port 502). 

# Variant 2:
The Ampere.IQ Box can be read out via a REST interface.
